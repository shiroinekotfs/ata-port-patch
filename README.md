## Perquisites

1. The primary target is running ATA gateway with the IIS-installed on Windows Server, without removing or stopping "Default Web Site" web service.
2. Security. You can move to another ports that is hard to detect or having too far from any normal range of ports, preventing it from being a target of a potential attack.
